 Week 15 & 16 Assignment
Task 1
Imported netflix_titles csv file successfully. No difficulties experienced during the import.
The interesting thing about the chosen dataset is most production is from the United States.

Task 2
Below are simple queries that I used to play with the dataset:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_shows FROM world.netflix_titles;
Result: 100
SELECT SUM(CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(duration, ' ', 1) AS UNSIGNED)) AS total_seasons FROM world.netflix_titles WHERE duration LIKE '%season%';
Result: 106
SELECT * FROM world.netflix_titles WHERE date_added BETWEEN 'September 10, 2021' AND 'September 15, 2021';
SELECT MAX(duration) AS highest_duration FROM world.netflix_titles; 
SELECT AVG(CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(duration, ' ', 1) AS DECIMAL(10,2))) AS average_duration FROM world.netflix_titles WHERE duration LIKE '%min%'
Result: 100.72 minutes

The hidden fact about the data is that;
The dataset includes exactly 100 shows.
There are a total of 106 seasons represented across all shows in the dataset.

Task 3
Retrieve all movies added after September 15, 2021?
SELECT * FROM world.netflix_titles WHERE type = 'Movie' AND date_added > 'September 15, 2021' ORDER BY date_added;
What is the average duration of shows in the dataset? 100.72 minutes

Task 4
Filtered the data using the following SQL queries then generated bar charts on Microsoft Excel, find the bar charts on a parallel file in this repository.
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS show_count FROM world.netflix_titles GROUP BY country ORDER BY show_count DESC;
SELECT listed_in, COUNT(*) as genre_count FROM world.netflix_titles GROUP BY listed_in ORDER BY genre_count DESC;
SELECT rating, COUNT(*) AS show_count FROM world.netflix_titles GROUP BY rating ORDER BY show_count DESC;
